// AnytimeProfile.kt — Per-family lifecycle/cadence resolver.
//
// CT3 4/4H is the primary target (cadence ~1/min, 16-day rated). CT4 / CT3_PLUS
// have shorter or longer rated lives depending on chemistry. CT5 (no separate
// transmitter) uses the same 3-minute tick scale in the official SDK
// (`Anytime`, endNumber 7695 => 16 days) and adds an encrypted identity/data
// layer on top of the usual 0x1000 GATT service.
